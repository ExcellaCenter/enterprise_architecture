What are the objective attributes that would make an architecture successful on this project?
Examples would be: 

code performance, 
scaleability, 
flexiblity, 
maintainablity, 
readability, 
code reuse, 
separation of concerns, 
fewer bugs, 
transparency of code impact, 
time to market of new features, 
time to resolution of maintaince issues, 
etc.



Knowing that many architectual decisions will impact two desireable attributes, which attributes would you be willing to sacrifice for gains in the opposite category?

possible examples performance vs. readability, 
code resuse vs. change isolation
